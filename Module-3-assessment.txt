 Module 3 Assesment:
Skills test: Write a (1) running java program example that using a thread, except stopwatch. Note: Add a folder on your repository and name it into.



public class Multi extends Thread{
@Override

public void run(){  
    String numbers = null;
 String name = numbers;
 
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; ++i) {
         System.out.println( " numbers"  + ' '+ "names" + '=' + i);
         
         
}
System.out.println("thread is running now...");  
System.out.println(" thread is already running ");
}  
public static void main(String args[]){  
    
Multi t1=new Multi();  
t1.start();

 Explain the advantages and disadvantages of treading and multithreading in java programming.
The advantages of treading:
.     1. Reduces development time.
     2. Reduces maintenance costs.
     3. Improves the performance of complex applications.
     4. Useful for improving the responsiveness of the user interfaces.
     5. Used in server applications for improving high throughput and resource utilization.
     6. Parallelize tasks.
    7. If a thread cannot use all the computing resources of the CPU (because instructions depend on each other's result), running another thread can avoid leaving these idle.
    8. If several threads work on the same set of data, they can actually share their cache, leading to better cache usage or synchronization on its values.
The disadvantage of treading:
. Multiple threads can interfere with each other when sharing hardware resources such as caches or translation look aside buffers (TLBs).
. Execution times of a single thread are not improved but can be degraded, even when only one thread is executing. This is due to slower frequencies and/or additional pipeline stages that are necessary to accommodate thread-switching hardware.
 . Hardware support for multithreading is more visible to software, thus requiring more changes to both application programs and operating systems than multiprocessing.

 The advantage of multithreading:
	Enhanced performance by decreased development time
	Simplified and streamlined program coding
	Improvised GUI responsiveness
	Simultaneous and parallelized occurrence of tasks
	Better use of cache storage by utilization of resources
	Decreased cost of maintenance
	Better use of CPU resource

The disadvantage of multithreading:

	Complex debugging and testing processes
	Overhead switching of context
	Increased potential for deadlock occurrence
	Increased difficulty level in writing a program
	Unpredictable results
