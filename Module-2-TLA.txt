B. EXPLORE: API Specifications list
1. Enumerate at least 20 following API specifications of java, depending of the java
version.
Java version: Java Virtual Machine
                                                  DESCRIPTION
The Java virtual machine is an abstract (virtual) computer defined by a specification. The garbage-collection algorithm used and any internal optimization of the Java virtual machine instructions (their translation into machine code) are not specified. The main reason for this omission is to not unnecessarily constrain implementers. Any Java application can be run only inside some concrete implementation of the abstract specification of the Java virtual machine

                                       INTERFACES
Java Virtual Machines - features, command-line options, and additional information.
               Java Native Interface - the interface which JVM TI extends.
         java.lang.instrument package - a Java programming language alternate to JVM TI if only the instrumentation functionality of JVM TI is used.

                                                                         CLASSES

A specification where working of Java Virtual Machine is specified. But implementation provider is independent to choose the algorithm. Its implementation has been provided by Oracle and other companies.
An implementation It implementation is known as JRE (Java Runtime Environment).
Runtime Instance Whenever you write java command on the command prompt to run the java class, an instance of JVM is created.
